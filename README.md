# Eldar_Torezan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This program is a fully functional pokedex with multiple functions. Our program takes information from a text file containing all 151 Pokemon. Our program will be able to pull up any information you want about a certain Pokemon. We utilize linked lists in order to categorize all the Pokemon by their respective types.

In order to run the program you must download the .h file as well as both .cpp files. The text file is vital for the program to be able to function. Without it, the info cannot be loaded and the program will be rendered useless. Make a new project in codeblocks (name doesn't matter) and then add the class PokemonEntris. After you've done this, copy/paste all the code into their respective files. Once you've done this, create a text file in the project folder called PokemonEntris.txt and copy past the info from the text file provided here into PokemonEntris.txt.

This program is dependent on the PokemonEntris.txt file.

Program will run on any system as long as c++ is installed.
